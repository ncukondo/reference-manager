# ROADMAP

This document tracks future development plans for reference-manager.

For completed features and changes, see [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

For detailed specifications, see [spec/](./spec/).

## Before Implementation

**Always read [`spec/meta/development-process.md`](./spec/meta/development-process.md) before starting any implementation work.**

This document defines the workflow including TDD process, quality checks, and commit guidelines.

## Completed Phases

- ✅ **Phase 1-5**: Core functionality, CLI commands, Server, Build & Distribution
- ✅ **Phase 6**: Citation Generation (cite command)
- ✅ **Phase 7**: Multi-Format Import (add command with BibTeX, RIS, DOI, PMID support)
- ✅ **Phase 8**: Operation Integration (unified operations pattern)
- ✅ **Phase 9**: Server Mode Performance Optimization (ExecutionContext pattern)
